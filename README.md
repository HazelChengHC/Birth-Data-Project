# Birth-Data-Project

The goal of this project is to do data analysis on baby births and populations on R studio to explore the distribution and tendency crossing recent 40 years in the United States by analyzing the relationship among geographical regions, states, races, baby weights, genders, and mother's age. Data visualization methods such as ggplots and boxplots are used in this project as well to help people draw patterns and make conclusions easily and precisely.

The dataset contains information about births in the United States. The full data set is from the Centers for Disease Control. The data for this project is a "small" sample (chosen at random) of slightly over one million records from the full data set. The data for this project also only contain a subset of the variables in the full data set.
